Gen Z Portfolio — Manual / Notes
================================

Quick Start
-----------
- Quick Intake: Fill First name, Surname, Age, and pick your Type.
  - Student → School field appears
  - Employee → Company field appears
  - Other → no extra fields
- Continue: Splash intro plays, then the portfolio reveals with a small welcome card.
- Replay splash: Add #intro to the URL to replay once this session (e.g., index.html#intro).
- Tabs: Home, Coding, Creative, About, Contact. Deep links: index.html#home, #coding, #creative, #about, #contact
- Command Palette: Press Cmd+K (Mac) / Ctrl+K (Win/Linux). Type to search; ↑/↓ to navigate; PageUp/PageDown/Home/End to move faster; Enter to run; Esc to close.
- Explore Work: Jumps to Coding tab. My Info: Jumps to About tab.
- Theme Toggle (header): Switch between default Pink gradient and Ambient auto‑accent.
- Download Resume: The hero button downloads portfolio/resume.pdf.

UX Features
-----------
- 3D Tilt: Cards subtly rotate toward your cursor/finger (hero tiles + coding cards). Respects “prefers-reduced-motion”.
- Spotlight on hover: Non‑hovered cards dim for focus in hero panel and coding grid.
- Sliding Sidebar: Hidden at left edge; reveal on hover/focus. Has an invisible hot‑zone and a small visible handle.
- Glassmorphism Hero: Animated color wash, gradient border, inner sheen.
- Micro‑interactions: Buttons zoom on hover/active (CTAs, sidebar, splash controls).
- Command‑K: Quick actions for tabs, projects, social links, “Install App”, sound/haptics toggles, themes, and “Download Resume”. Keyboard paging supported.
- Sound & Haptics: Palette plays soft beeps and haptics on open/close/move/select. Toggle via palette.
- Theme System: Default Pink gradient is kept. Ambient mode auto‑extracts accent colors from your profile GIF (idle_animation.gif) and applies them to gradients; toggled via the header button or Command‑K.
- Mood Themes (Cmd+K): Pink (default), Ambient (auto), Focus (high‑contrast), Noir (mono), Retro Pixel (playful). Themes persist.
- Splash Avatar: The circular GIF appears in the splash, then animates to the hero name slot after dismiss (FLIP). Respects reduced‑motion.
- Storytelling Case Study: A desktop timeline (Problem → Approach → Impact) with a synced visual panel under Home.
- Logout Overlay: Full‑screen GIF displayed during logout; delay is configurable. On logout, the intake form resets and the welcome card is removed.
- Centered Loading Overlay: Small, centered loading GIF with matching background color. Default color is #ffbd68 and can be overridden via the CSS variable --loading-bg on #login-loading.

Command Palette (highlights)
----------------------------
- Open: Cmd/Ctrl+K
- Categories: Tabs (Home/Coding/Creative/About/Contact), Projects (cards), Quick Actions (Explore Work, My Info, Contact, Download Resume), Social links, Settings (Toggle Sound/Haptics), Themes (Pink/Ambient/Focus/Noir/Retro), Install App (when available)
- Keys: ↑/↓ navigate • Enter run • Esc close • Click items to run
- Settings persistence: localStorage keys fx:sound (on/off), fx:haptics (on/off)

PWA (Progressive Web App)
-------------------------
- What you get: Installable app window; offline support; faster reloads; custom theme color.
- Install: Use browser Install menu or Command‑K → "Install App" (shows only when available).
- Icons: Place 192×192 and 512×512 PNGs here:
  - portfolio/icons/icon-192.png
  - portfolio/icons/icon-512.png
- Shortcuts (long‑press icon): Coding tab and About tab.
- Offline: If a page isn’t cached, the app shows a friendly offline page.
- Caching strategy:
  - HTML: Network‑first; if offline, fallback to offline.html
  - Assets (CSS/JS/images): Stale‑while‑revalidate (serve cache, update in background)
- Background Sync (Intake): If an intake submit fails (offline/server down), it is queued locally (IndexedDB in the service worker, with a localStorage fallback) and retried later when online. A “Retry save” button also appears on the welcome card for manual sync.
  - Support: Background Sync is available in Chromium‑based browsers. When not available, auto‑flush still occurs on page load or when the browser goes online.
- Updates: New service worker auto‑installs; reload to activate. Cache version: portfolio‑v2
- Clear/Reset: In browser devtools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister; clear site data; reload.

Achievements & Badges (Trophy Case)
-----------------------------------
- Where: Home tab → "Trophy Case" card.
- Badges:
  - First Visit — awarded after successful intake.
  - 8‑bit Mode — awarded when you trigger the Konami easter egg.
  - Installed App — awarded after installing the PWA.
  - Resume Analyzed — reserved for Resume Analyzer success (to be wired on the analyzer page).
- Storage: Badges are saved per name in localStorage under ach:<lowercased full name>.
- Sync: "Sync" merges your local badges with the server using a privacy‑friendly hashed key (no raw names stored in the server file).
- Reset: "Reset" clears local badges for the current name only.

Easter Egg — 8‑bit Mode (Konami)
---------------------------------
- Trigger: ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A
- Effect: Pixel font + CRT scanline overlay and confetti burst. Auto‑fades after ~8s.
- Disable early: Press Esc or click the overlay.
- Notes: In Safe Mode, confetti is disabled and overlay intensity is reduced.

Developer Mode Overlays
-----------------------
- Toggle: Shift + D
- Effect: Grid overlay + FPS badge (for layout and performance diagnostics).

Accessibility
-------------
- Reduced motion: Disables tilt, minimizes animations.
- Keyboard: Palette and splash are keyboard accessible; tabs are buttons.
- High contrast path via Focus theme (Cmd+K → Theme: Focus).
- Safe Mode: Header toggle reduces effects globally (disables confetti, blur, heavy motion).

Backend — Resume Analyzer, Intake CSV, Achievements
--------------------------------------------------
- Location: Backend/resume-backend (Node/Express)
- Configure: Set HF_API_TOKEN in backend/.env
- Start: npm start (from the backend folder). Default port: 3001
- Health checks: GET / and GET /health
- Intake logging:
  - POST /intake appends to data/intake.csv (header auto‑creates)
  - GET /intake.csv downloads the CSV
  - CORS enabled for local development
  - Frontend will try port 3001, then 3002
- Achievements API (privacy‑friendly):
  - GET /achievements?first=<first>&last=<last> (or key=<shortHash>) → { key, badges }
  - POST /achievements/award with JSON { first, last, badge } (or key + badge) → { ok, key, badge, ts }
  - Storage file: data/achievements.json keyed by a short hash of the normalized name (no raw names stored).

Deep Links / Routing
--------------------
- Open specific tabs via hash: #home, #coding, #creative, #about, #contact
- On load and hash changes, the app activates the matching tab.
- Replay splash this session: #intro

Troubleshooting
---------------
- No sound: Most browsers require a user gesture first; also check Settings → Toggle Sound in Command‑K.
- No haptics: Only devices/browsers supporting vibration will vibrate.
- "Install App" missing: Only appears when install is available (Chromium browsers; served over localhost/HTTPS).
- Offline not working: Ensure service worker is installed (check Application tab). Reload after first visit.
- Sidebar not visible on mobile: Hidden under 820px viewport width by design.
- Tilt feels heavy: System setting “Reduce Motion” will disable it.
- Splash avatar missing: Ensure portfolio/idle_animation.gif exists. The splash preloads it; reload once. If still missing, clear cache and retry.
- Logout delay too long/short: Edit index.html → #logout-overlay data-delay (milliseconds). Example: data-delay="1000".
- Intake.csv not updating:
  - Make sure the backend is running: from Backend/resume-backend, run npm start
  - Test POST: curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/intake -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"first":"A","last":"B","age":20,"type":"student","school":"NCF","company":""}'
  - Verify file: Backend/resume-backend/data/intake.csv
  - If offline, the UI will show “Saved locally” with a Retry save button; it will auto‑sync when back online.

Upcoming / Extras
-----------------
- Shareable Postcard: One‑click “Generate Postcard” renders your avatar + gradient + name into a canvas image for download/share. If triggered from a demo page, it auto‑includes that demo’s title. Intended entry points: a header button and Command‑K action.
